# 🛡️ GGS: Guardian Graph System

**Active defense. Tactical frustration. Adaptive containment.**  
GGS is a modular cybersecurity tool designed to detect, deceive, and contain malicious actors in Linux systems. Its approach is not just reactive—it aims to **anticipate and destabilize** attackers through decoys, intelligent monitoring, and controlled responses.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Strategic deception:** Generates honeypots and bait files to attract and flag suspicious behavior.
- **Dynamic risk assessment:** Assigns user risk levels based on access patterns, active processes, and behavioral tags.
- **Modular containment:** Detects encryption attempts in honeypots and triggers isolation measures (Docker, network monitoring, etc.).
- **Persistent logging:** Structured event logging with timestamps, severity levels, and contextual data, environment-configurable.
- **Scalable architecture:** Clear separation between core (`core/`), utilities (`utils/`), and tests (`tests/`), with external configuration (`config.yaml`).

---

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jurgen-dev/GGS.git
cd GGS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

To run the full test suite:

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

This prepares the environment, regenerates honeypots, clears logs, and executes all modules in isolated mode.

## 🧠 System Philosophy

GGS doesn’t aim to block attackers—it aims to **confuse, slow down, and expose** them.  
Every honeypot interaction, suspicious process, and encryption attempt is an opportunity to tag, log, and respond.  
This system is designed to be **extended, audited, and adapted** by the community. Its modularity allows for new detection techniques, CLI visualization, or even automated responses.

## 🗂️ GitHub Issue: Roadmap for v0.2.0

```markdown
### 📍 Roadmap: GGS v0.2.0

This issue outlines the planned features and improvements for the next release of Guardian Graph System (GGS).

---

## 🔧 Core Objectives

- [ ] **CLI Visualization Module**  
  Real-time display of honeypot interactions, risk levels, and containment triggers.

- [ ] **Attack Simulation Engine**  
  Simulate common attacker behaviors to test GGS responses and logging accuracy.

- [ ] **SIEM Integration (Phase 1)**  
  Export structured logs to external systems (e.g., Splunk, ELK) via JSON or syslog.

- [ ] **Protocol Decoy Expansion**  
  Add FTP, SSH, and HTTP honeypots with configurable behavior.

- [ ] **Improved Risk Scoring Logic**  
  Refine user profiling based on process trees, access frequency, and anomaly detection.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Stability

- [ ] Expand test coverage for new modules
- [ ] Add stress tests for honeypot generation and containment triggers
- [ ] Validate compatibility across major Linux distros

---

## 📚 Documentation

- [ ] Update README with new features
- [ ] Add usage examples for CLI visualization
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md for external collaborators

---

Feel free to suggest additional features or improvements below.  
Let’s build GGS into a reference tool for open-source digital defense.
